# Building From Scratch

Welcome to **Building From Scratch**, a comprehensive collection of implementations of foundational AI, machine learning, and deep learning architectures and components — all built from the ground up with minimal dependencies.

---

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- Deepen understanding of core AI/ML/DL concepts by implementing models and systems from first principles.
- Showcase hands-on expertise by replicating key architectures from seminal papers.
- Provide educational code that is easy to follow and modify, useful for both academic study and industry preparation.
- Serve as a portfolio to demonstrate my skills in AI and ML fundamentals.

**Note:**  
This repo focuses on **re-implementations and training of known models and components**. Novel research or experimental work will be maintained in separate repositories.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- **Tokenizers**  
  Implementations of tokenization techniques for various data types including text, vision, and audio.

- **Transformers**  
  Variants of transformer architectures applied to NLP and computer vision tasks.

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
  Classic and modern CNN architectures implemented from scratch.

- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
  Fundamental sequence models and their variants.

- **Training Utilities**  
  Scripts and helpers to train and evaluate models with minimal external libraries.

- **Utils**  
  Common utilities such as data loaders, activation functions, and loss implementations.
